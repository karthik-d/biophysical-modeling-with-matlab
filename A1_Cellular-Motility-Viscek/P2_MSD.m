Calculate the mean squared displacement (MSD) averaged over all
particles in the system for different values of the noise; use η = 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 and
0.8, and at fixed packing fraction φ = 0.5. Use a simulation with at least NT = 5 × 104
steps, and neglect data from the first 2500 steps. Make a plot of MSD vs. the time
window size ∆t for these different values for the noise. As in assignment 0, calculate
the diffusion coefficient D and power law α from the plotted data; make a plot of
D and α as a function of noise η.
